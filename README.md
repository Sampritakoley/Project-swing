#Consumer Loan Assistant Project Preview:

In this project, i have builded a consumer loan assistant. You input a loan balance and yearly interest
rate. You then have two options: (1) enter the desired number of payments and the loan assistant
computes the monthly payment, or (2) enter the desired monthly payment and the loan assistant
determines the number of payments you will make. An analysis of your loan, including total of
payments and interest paid is also provided.
All label controls are used for title information. Two button controls are used to compute results
and to start a new analysis. Two small button controls (marked with X; only one is seen at a time)
control whether you compute the number of payments or the payment amount. One button exits the
project. Four text field controls are used for inputs and a large text area is used to present the loan
analysis results.
In this initial configuration, you enter a Loan Balance, an Interest Rate (annual rate as a
percentage) and a Number of Payments value. Click Compute Monthly Payment. The payment
will appear in the ‘yellow’ text field and a complete loan analysis will appear in the large text
field.
